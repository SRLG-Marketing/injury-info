# üèõÔ∏è Legal Injury Advocates - Reputable Sources Setup

## üéØ Overview

Your reputable sources system has been updated to **include only relevant sources** in AI responses. This ensures that users receive the most helpful and contextually appropriate links in the "Other Helpful Sources" section, including medical and legal information sources that are directly relevant to their query.

## üöÄ How It Works

### Relevant Source Selection
- **Total Sources**: Up to 4 sources per response
- **Source Types**: Medical, government, research, legal sources
- **Relevance-Based**: Only includes sources that are relevant to the user's query
- **Fallback Protection**: If Google Sheets is unavailable, fallback sources are used

### Source Priority
1. **Relevant Sources**: Sources that best match the user's query
2. **Medical Sources**: Mayo Clinic, NIH, CDC, etc.
3. **Government Sources**: FDA, EPA, court records
4. **Research Sources**: Academic studies, peer-reviewed papers

## üìä Google Sheets Setup

### Add LIA Sources to Your "Reputable_Sources" Sheet

Add these columns to your existing Google Sheets "Reputable_Sources" tab:

| Disease_Ailment | Source_Title | Source_URL | Source_Type | Priority | Keywords | Description | Last_Updated | Active |
|-----------------|--------------|------------|-------------|----------|----------|-------------|--------------|--------|
| Legal Assistance | Legal Injury Advocates - Free Case Evaluation | https://legalinjuryadvocates.com | LIA | 1 | legal help, injury claims, compensation, lawsuit, legal advice, case evaluation | Free case evaluation and legal assistance for injury claims | 2024-01-15 | TRUE |
| Mesothelioma | Legal Injury Advocates - Mesothelioma Cases | https://legalinjuryadvocates.com/mesothelioma | LIA | 1 | mesothelioma, asbestos, legal help, compensation | Specialized legal assistance for mesothelioma cases | 2024-01-15 | TRUE |
| PFAS Exposure | Legal Injury Advocates - PFAS Lawsuits | https://legalinjuryadvocates.com/pfas | LIA | 1 | pfas, forever chemicals, water contamination, legal help | Legal assistance for PFAS exposure claims | 2024-01-15 | TRUE |
| Roundup Cancer | Legal Injury Advocates - Roundup Lawsuits | https://legalinjuryadvocates.com/roundup | LIA | 1 | roundup, glyphosate, weed killer, cancer, legal help | Legal assistance for Roundup cancer cases | 2024-01-15 | TRUE |

### Key Guidelines for LIA Sources

1. **Source_Type**: Use whatever label you want - it will display exactly as you type it
   - Examples: "Legal Injury Advocates", "LIA Blog Post", "LIA", "Legal Help"
2. **Priority**: Always set to 1 (highest priority)
3. **Keywords**: Include relevant case-specific terms plus "legal help", "compensation", "lawsuit"
4. **Active**: Always set to TRUE
5. **URLs**: Use specific landing pages when available

**Note:** The system displays your `Source_Type` exactly as you typed it in Google Sheets - no mapping or processing is done.

## üîß System Configuration

### Current Settings
- **Total Sources**: 4 per response
- **LIA Sources**: 1 guaranteed per response
- **Fallback**: Built-in LIA sources when Google Sheets unavailable
- **Source Types**: Medical, Government, Research, Legal, LIA

### How Sources Are Selected
1. **All Sources**: System finds all relevant sources (medical, government, research, legal)
2. **Scoring**: Each source is scored based on relevance to the user's query
3. **Deduplication**: System removes any duplicate URLs to ensure unique sources
4. **Final Selection**: Top scoring unique sources up to the limit (typically 5 sources)

## üß™ Testing

Test the LIA source inclusion:

```bash
node test-reputable-sources.js
```

This will verify that:
- Sources are properly detected and scored
- Relevant sources appear in responses
- Sources are properly formatted and linked
- Fallback sources work when Google Sheets is unavailable

## üì± Example Response

When a user asks about mesothelioma, they'll see:

```
